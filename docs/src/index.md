# PlutoVSCodeDebugger

Documentation for [PlutoVSCodeDebugger](https://github.com/disberd/PlutoVSCodeDebugger.jl).

This package provides convenience functions and macros to connect an active VSCode instance to a running Pluto notebook mostly for debugging purposes.

Once connected, the exported macros (mostly mirrored from the ones in JuliaInterpreter) can be used to start debugging code from the Pluto workspace using the VSCode debugging interface.
